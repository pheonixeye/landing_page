              App</a></li>
          <p>My first project as a Flutter developer, deployed onto the Google PlayStore. In this application I used the
            already researched IIEF-15 questionnaire for evaluation of erectile dysfunction in men. I learned the basics
            of navigation & styling in Flutter as well as implemening many basic to mid level dart language concepts.
          </p>
          <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=drkareemzaher.cosmosurgeclinicsapp">CosmoSurge
              Clinics
              App</a></li>
          <p>In this project I implemented what I learned in dart language about API calls, Managing state in Flutter
            using the provider package, Advanced routing & navigation, Custom styling & creation of reusable components.
            It is a Doctor / Clinic Booking app with backend deployed on Oracle Cloud Network.
          </p>
          <li><a href="https://www.cosmosurgecairo.com">CosmoSurge Clinics Website</a></li>
          <p>The website counterpart of CosmoSurge Clinics Mobile App with the same functionalities & deployed with
            Firebase Hosting. It was a good introduction to the Flutter WEB echosystem with a small introduction to
            HTMl/CSS.
          </p>
          <li><a href="https://www.proclinicsystems.com">ProClinic Systems Website</a></li>
          <p>It's a landing page created with Flutter to demo ProClinic "Clinic Management Software" with links to
            Youtube explanation videos in Arabic, Important app features, Contact details & a downloadable link to the
            demo application.
          </p>
          <li><a href="https://www.testtube.app">TestTube.app</a></li>
          <p>A Marketplace for Quizzes in different subjects. Each user has a profile with a login / logout function,
            changing profile information & phone number.
            You log in, select which instructors to follow & show their uploaded quizzes, put a quiz in your favorites &
            purchase a quiz.</p>
          <p>It was a challening project overall, it consisted of 4 major parts: a Marketplace website for students, a
            windows application for instructors to add & customize their quizzes, a mobile android application for
            students to login & access their purchased quizzes with an exam mode & a study mode & finally a backend
            server that is 24/7 online deployed on VULTUR.
          </p>
          <li><a href="https://www.kareemzaher.com">My Clinic Website</a></li>
          <p>Created with wordpress &#128517;, Has my clinic contact information & working hours. Yet I recently used
            Flutter WEB to improve / change certain pages of the website using IFRAMES, a little hacky I know &#128517;
            & is 100% functional & woking.
